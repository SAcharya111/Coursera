## Instructions
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Review criteria
The rubric contains the following two questions:

Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that youâ€™re grading this assignment?
Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?

## Creating Data Frame With the Following Details
#### 1.Country 2.Latitude 3.Longitude 4.New Cases in May 5.Latest Count of Vaccinated Population in May 6.Population of Country
Source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19: JHU CSSE Covid-19 Data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
md_country <- data.frame(Country = c("Afghanistan","Bangladesh",
"Bhutan","India","Indonesia","Myanmar","Pakistan","Sri Lanka"),
             lat=c(33.9391,23.685,27.5142,20.5937,0.7893, 21.9162,30.3753,7.8731),
             lon = c(67.71,90.3563, 90.4336, 78.9629,  113.9213,95.956, 69.3451,80.7718),
            New_Cases = c(8621,35853,417,8390488,129131, 597,88265,66715),
            Total_Vaccinations = c(590454,9901717,482716,201203166,25782177,2994900,

pop = c( 38928341, 164689383,  771612,  1380004385, 273523621, 54409794, 220892331,  21413250))

head(md_country,n=30)
```

## Creating New Metric - Number of Vaccinations Given as % of Population of Country
Age and other exclusion criteria for not administering vaccines are not considered
```{r, echo=TRUE}
md_country$pop_vaccine = (md_country$Total_Vaccinations/md_country$pop)*100
md_country$sqrt_cases = sqrt(md_country$New_Cases)
head(md_country)
```

## Visualization using leaflet
### Pop-up Colours - 
They denote population % Vaccinated (>=50 : Green, >=15 and < 50 : Orange, < 15 : Red), Only Bhutan is green right now while all the other countries are red.

### Labels - 
They have details on New Cases in May and Latest Vaccination Numbers respectively

### Circles 
They denote the count of new cases, highlighting the need to vaccinate quickly in countries with larger circles


```{r, echo=TRUE}
labs <- lapply(seq(nrow(md_country)), function(i) {
  paste0( '<p>', md_country[i, "Country"], '<p></p>', 
          md_country[i, "New_Cases"], '</p><p>', 
          md_country[i, "Total_Vaccinations"],'</p><p>')
       })


getColor <- function(pop_vaccine) {
  sapply(md_country$pop_vaccine, function(pop_vaccine) {
  if(pop_vaccine >= 50) {
    "green"
  } else if(pop_vaccine >=15) {
    "orange"
  } else {
    "red"
  } })
}

icons <- awesomeIcons(
  icon = 'ios-close',
  iconColor = 'black',
  library = 'ion',
  markerColor = getColor(md_country)
)

  addTiles() %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(~lon, ~lat,icon=icons, popup = ~as.character(Country), label = lapply(labs,htmltools::HTML))%>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = (md_country$sqrt_cases)*200)



```
